This xml configures a 4-wheel chassis, with 2 big wheels and 2 small wheels.

It is supposed to have a better differential drive, but this work is mainly on testing configuration.

Two front wheels use velocity command and two rear wheels use motor command. The default density of the body material is much heavier than I thought.

A velocity sensor has been added.
